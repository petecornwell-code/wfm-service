# Phase 13 — Validation Strategy

> Per-phase validation contract for feedback sampling during execution.

---

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework** | {see 13-RESEARCH.md "Validation Architecture" — backend JUnit/Gradle; frontend has NO test framework} |
| **Config file** | {path or "none — Wave 0 installs"} |
| **Quick run command** | `{quick command}` |
| **Full suite command** | `{full command}` |
| **Estimated runtime** | ~{N} seconds |

---

## Sampling Rate

- **After every task commit:** Run `{quick run command}`
- **After every plan wave:** Run `{full suite command}`
- **Before `/gsd-verify-work`:** Full suite must be green
- **Max feedback latency:** {N} seconds

## Per-Task Verification Map

| Task ID | Plan | Wave | Requirement | Threat Ref | Secure Behavior | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists | Status |
|---------|------|------|-------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| 13-01-01 | 01 | 1 | MDL-02 | T-13-01 / — | {expected secure behavior or "N/A"} | unit | `{command}` | ✅ / ❌ W0 | ⬜ pending |

*Status: ⬜ pending · ✅ green · ❌ red · ⚠️ flaky*

---

## Wave 0 Requirements

- [ ] {test file stubs — filled by the planner from 13-RESEARCH.md Validation Architecture}

*If none: "Existing infrastructure covers all phase requirements."*

---

## Manual-Only Verifications

| Behavior | Requirement | Why Manual | Test Instructions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| Roster UI surfaces Mon–Sun hours, MANDATORY, PTO | UPL-03/04/05 | No frontend test framework exists in this repo (verified in research) | {steps} |

*If none: "All phase behaviors have automated verification."*

---

## Validation Sign-Off

- [ ] All tasks have `<automated>` verify or Wave 0 dependencies
- [ ] Sampling continuity: no 3 consecutive tasks without automated verify
- [ ] Wave 0 covers all MISSING references
- [ ] No watch-mode flags
- [ ] Feedback latency < {N}s
- [ ] `nyquist_compliant: true` set in frontmatter

**Approval:** pending
